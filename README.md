# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this project was to collect weather data from around the world using the OpenWeatherMap API for PLANMYTRIP, a top travel technology company that specializes in internet-related services in the hotel and lodging industry. This data was then used to recommend ideal hotels, based on clientâ€™s weather preferences. Along the way we will be generating the following visualizations comparing Latitude with temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed:

* Create scatter plots of the weather data for each of the variables.
* Determine the correlations using linear regressions to find the relationships between each of the variables.
* Create a series of heatmaps using the Google Maps and Places API that showcases the comparison between latitude and each of the variables.
   
The project concludes with enhancing all of the above data by providing the client with a map of cities that match their weather preferences, allowing them to pick 4 of those cities (within the same country), and provides them with a detailed travel itinerary. The itinerary includes driving directions for a roundtrip journey starting and ending in their desired city, with 3 city stops along the way, as well as detailed weather information for each city.
